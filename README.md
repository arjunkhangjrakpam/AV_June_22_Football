### Player Performance Assessment


Can you predict the rating of a football player in a given match as a function of physical, contextual, kinematical, technical, and tactical data-related player, his team, and the opponent for FC Sevilla and FC Bengaluru United?


Can you connect human perception of a playerÂ´s performance to the fundamental actions that such a player carries out on the pitch?




### Introduction and Context


Nowadays, large sets of data offer a deep description of both players and team actions during matches. Information contained in such datasets ranges from physical and kinematic variables to complex game-related technical and tactical metrics. Nevertheless, and despite the emergence of such rich and precise datasets, the main open problem keeps being the identification of the key actions that make outstanding the performance of players in the whole spectrum of roles and positions. In this competition, you will use Sevilla FC and FC Bengaluru United's large scouting datasets to relate human-based player evaluations to physical, contextual, kinematic, technical, and tactical variables of players, teams, and opponents. You will produce an algorithm that will be able to decompose the performance of the players into its main fundamental components.




### Objective

The main goal of the problem is to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts the scout-made evaluation of players in the context of given matches.
